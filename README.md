## Installing wxWidgets:
1. Download and run the Windows installer for 3.0.5 (latest stable release)

   https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

2. Navigate to the install directory (hopefully C:\wxWidgets-3.0.5) then \build\msw
3. Open wx_vc10.sln in Visual Studios 2017. Let it convert everything to v141. (2019 with v142 works too)
4. Build the solution.
5. Set the WXWIN environment variable to the install directory if the installer didn't. 

   See https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Adding_an_Environment_Variable_under_Windows

   Make sure to include a backslash on the end: "C:\wxWidgets-3.0.3\\"

## Other Requirements
1. Add another environemnt variable "C:\Users\Sean\Documents\MIVCOTS-Public\projects\mivcots\Resources\\" with the variable name "MivcotsResources"

7. set the root password as "Telemetry" no quotes and then click next.
8. Default Instance Properties are good as is so click Next.
9. You can provide feedback if you want then click Next.
10. On the next screen click Install
11. When the installation is complete run the HeidiSQL program on your desktop and make sure there is a session and you can sign into it with the User:root and Password:Telemetry.
